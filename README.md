# Prize Squares

Inspired by TV games shows. Prize Square allows a host to ask a contestant to pick a square then the host will reveal the contestant's prize.

The squares have three states.

- Normal
- Selected
- Passed

Select the square by clicking on the present icon. Clicking on the present icon will cycle through the three states.

To reveal the prize, the square must be in the Selected or Passed state then click on the eye icon. To hide the prize, click on the eye icon again.
