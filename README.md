# Prize Squares

Inspired by TV games shows. The host asks the contestant to pick a square. But before the host reveals the prize the host could ask the contestant if they are sure they want the picked square.

Clicking on the present icon selects the square.  When the square is selected, clicking on the eye icon will reveal the prize.
